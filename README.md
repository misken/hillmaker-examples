Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts illustrating use of hillmaker

Since GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, you can view any of the notebooks
just by navigating to the notebooks folder in this repo or
you can see an html version of the [basic_usage_shortstay_unit notebook here](https://misken.github.io/hillmaker-examples/basic_usage_shortstay_unit_040.html).

To get everything, just clone this repo or use the **Download ZIP** button.

Right now there's just a single notebook and two Python scripts. More examples
are on the way.
