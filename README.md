# hillmaker-examples

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts illustrating use of hillmaker.

Since GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, you can view any of the notebooks
just by navigating to the notebooks folder in this repo. 

To get everything, just clone this repo or use the **Download ZIP** button. In order to use the notebooks you
need to install hillmaker into a virtual environment and then use that environment from within the notebooks.

    pip install hillmaker

You should also be able to install hillmaker from conda-forge shortly into a virtual environment.

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    conda install hillmaker
