# hillmaker-examples

Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts illustrating use of hillmaker.

Since GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, you can view any of the notebooks
just by navigating to the notebooks folder in this repo. 

To get everything, just clone this repo or use the **Download ZIP** button.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** A new release of hillmaker is planned for November, 2023. This release will have numerous API changes along with [actual documentation](https://hillmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). The notebooks used in the documentation are available in this repo.
