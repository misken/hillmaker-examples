# hillmaker-examples

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts illustrating use of hillmaker.

Since GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, you can view any of the notebooks
just by navigating to the notebooks folder in this repo. 

To get everything, just clone this repo or use the **Download ZIP** button. In order to use the notebooks you
need to install hillmaker into a virtual environment and then use that environment from within the notebooks.

    pip install hillmaker

**IMPORTANT NOTE** A new release of hillmaker (0.8.0) is planned for November, 2023. This release will have numerous API changes along with [actual documentation](https://hillmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). The notebooks used in the documentation are available in this repo. This new release isn't available yet in PyPI. If you
want to install it, you can use pip to install it from the `develop` branch:

    pip install git+https://github.com/misken/hillmaker@develop
